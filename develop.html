                Who is Charles Babbag
            </h1>
            <p class="re">Charles Babbage, <span class="che">(born December 26, 1791, London, England—died October 18,
                    1871, London)</span>,<br>
                In 1812 Babbage helped found the Analytical Society, whose object was to introduce developments from the
                European continent into English mathematics. In 1816 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of
                London. He was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical (1820) and Statistical (1834) societies.

                The idea of mechanically calculating mathematical tables first came to Babbage in 1812 or 1813. Later he
                made a small calculator that could perform certain mathematical computations to eight decimals. Then in
                1823 he obtained government support for the design of a projected machine, the Difference Engine, with a
                20-decimal capacity. The Difference Engine was a digital device: it operated on discrete digits rather
                than smooth quantities, and the digits were decimal (0–9), represented by positions on toothed wheels
                rather than binary digits (“bits”). When one of the toothed wheels turned from nine to zero, it caused
                the next wheel to advance one position, carrying the digit. Like modern computers, the Difference Engine
                had storage—that is, a place where data could be held temporarily for later processing. Its construction
                required the development of mechanical engineering techniques, to which Babbage of necessity devoted
                himself. In the meantime (1828–39), he served as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of
                Cambridge. However, the full engine, designed to be room-sized, was never built, at least not by
                Babbage. All design and construction ceased in 1833, when Joseph Clement, the machinist responsible for
                actually building the machine, refused to continue unless he was prepaid.

                The completed portion of Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, 1832. This advanced calculator was
                intended to produce logarithm tables used in navigation. The value of numbers was represented by the
                positions of the toothed wheels marked with decimal numbers.

                During the mid-1830s Babbage developed plans for the Analytical Engine, the forerunner of the modern
                digital computer. In that device he envisioned the capability of performing any arithmetical operation
                on the basis of instructions from punched cards, a memory unit in which to store numbers, sequential
                control, and most of the other basic elements of the present-day computer. As with the Difference
                Engine, the project was far more complex than anything theretofore built. The memory unit was to be
                large enough to hold 1,000 50-digit numbers; this was larger than the storage capacity of any computer
                built before 1960. The machine was to be steam-driven and run by one attendant.

                In 1843 Babbage’s friend mathematician Ada Lovelace translated a French paper about the Analytical
                Engine and, in her own annotations, published how it could perform a sequence of calculations, the first
                computer program. The Analytical Engine, however, was never completed. Babbage’s design was forgotten
                until his unpublished notebooks were discovered in 1937. In 1991 British scientists built Difference
                Engine No. 2—accurate to 31 digits—to Babbage’s specifications, and in 2000 the printer for the
                Difference Engine was also built.

                Babbage made notable contributions in other areas as well. He assisted in establishing the modern postal
                system in England and compiled the first reliable actuarial tables. He also invented a type of
                speedometer and the locomotive cowcatcher.
