                    Who is Charles Babbag
                </h1>
                <p class="re">Charles Babbage, <span class="che">(born December 26, 1791, London, England—died October
                        18,
                        1871, London)</span>,<br>
                    In 1812 Babbage helped found the Analytical Society, whose object was to introduce developments from
                    the
                    European continent into English mathematics. In 1816 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of
                    London. He was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical (1820) and Statistical (1834)
                    societies.

                    The idea of mechanically calculating mathematical tables first came to Babbage in 1812 or 1813.
                    Later he
                    made a small calculator that could perform certain mathematical computations to eight decimals. Then
                    in
                    1823 he obtained government support for the design of a projected machine, the Difference Engine,
                    with a
                    20-decimal capacity. The Difference Engine was a digital device: it operated on discrete digits
                    rather
                    than smooth quantities, and the digits were decimal (0–9), represented by positions on toothed
                    wheels
                    rather than binary digits (“bits”). When one of the toothed wheels turned from nine to zero, it
                    caused
                    the next wheel to advance one position, carrying the digit. Like modern computers, the Difference
                    Engine
                    had storage—that is, a place where data could be held temporarily for later processing. Its
                    construction
                    required the development of mechanical engineering techniques, to which Babbage of necessity devoted
                    himself. In the meantime (1828–39), he served as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University
                    of
                    Cambridge. However, the full engine, designed to be room-sized, was never built, at least not by
                    Babbage. All design and construction ceased in 1833, when Joseph Clement, the machinist responsible
                    for
                    actually building the machine, refused to continue unless he was prepaid.
